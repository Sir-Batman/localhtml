This project started off as a way to have a localy sourced new tab page in a web browser (firefox, in this case).
The source for this need was in my constant switching of operating systems. 
Since I never really bothered too much to get bookmark syncing setup, I decided to teach myself html and create a page that I could view when I open a new tab, and use that as a "bookmark bar", so to speak.

The first version uploaded to Github is more advanced than what was first around on my pc. The first few iterations were simple, 1 column html.
Now, the page incorperates CSS from Bootstrap to create an advanced layout.

If you want to use this code as a model, feel free, of course. But be aware that this project depends on:

DEPENDENCIES
============

-Bootstrap CSS libraries

And in the future, will most likely require JQuery and some Bootstrap javascripting templates or stuff.
(and if you have not heard of Bootstrap, go check them out -- its an amazing, simple to use, really slick web design suite that makes starting websites very easy)

In the coming months, expect this repo to reflect the growing demands from this local site, from becoming a simple page of links, to a fully functional site that with all sorts of cool functions.

Anyways, this is what this repo is about, and what to expect in the future. 

(note -- if people want, I can upload the images folder. As of now, it is being left out on purpose.)
